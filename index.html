        <p>Hello! my name is Orji Emmanuel, I am from the eastern part of Nigeria.
            I am a very methodical person and also detail oriented in my actions.
            I love writing codes to improve my skills and in being creative.
            currently, I am studing software development in BYU and I hope to create
            a wonderful website that will support me and the future generation.
            I am a curious and growth-driven coder who sees programming as more than just writing code—it’s a lifestyle.
            I
            enjoy turning
            ideas into functional solutions and constantly pushing myself to learn, build, and improve.

            My coding journey is fueled by consistency, problem-solving, and a strong desire to understand how things
            work under the
            hood. I spend time experimenting, breaking things (on purpose 😅), fixing bugs, and refining my logic until
            solutions
            make sense—not just to the computer, but to me.

            I value:

            Continuous learning – I’m always improving my skills and exploring new tools and technologies.

            Clean, logical thinking – Writing code that is readable, efficient, and purposeful.

            Practical problem-solving – Using code to solve real-world problems, not just theoretical ones.

            Discipline & focus – Balancing learning, practice, and rest as part of my coding lifestyle.

            Coding for me is a mix of creativity and structure. Some days are about intense focus and debugging; other
            days are
            about learning, brainstorming, and building something new from scratch. Every line of code is a step
            forward.</p>
