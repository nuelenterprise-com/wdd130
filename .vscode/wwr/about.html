            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>History of Whitewater Rafting
                Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt to navigate the Snake
                River in Wyoming was
                planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment, the river was found to be too difficult and
                dangerous.
                Hence, it was given the nickname ‚ÄúMad River.‚Äù

                The first rubber raft was made by Lt. John Fremont and Horace H. Day believed to be built it the 1840s.
                They planned to
                survey the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. Although invented back then, it was'nt until the turn of
                the century that
                the first commercial rafting trip took place. On June 9, 1940, Clyde Smith lead a successful trip
                through the Snake
                River Canyon. In later years, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. constructed a modern resort hotel in Grand Teton
                National Park.
                In the late 1950s the lodge began offering float trips. They used surplus war rafts that were 8 ft wide
                by 27 ft long.
                Less than 500 people went that year but the demand started increasing. It was,nt until the 1960s and 70s
                that whitewater
                rafting companies started forming. In the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, whitewater rafting was included
                for the first
                time. Now whitewater rafting has risen to a popular sport and hobby, growing more and more every year.
